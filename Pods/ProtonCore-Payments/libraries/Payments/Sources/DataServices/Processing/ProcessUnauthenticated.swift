 General overview of transforming IAP into Proton product in the signup flow

 The process consists of two parts — before the user account is created and after the user account is created

 The first part — before the user account is created:
 0. Let the user choose and buy the IAP through native system UI
 1. Get informed about unfinished IAP transactions from StoreKit's payment queue
 2. Determine what product has been purchased via IAP and what is this product's Proton price
 3. Obtain the StoreKit receipt that hopefully confirms the IAP purchase (we don't check this locally)
    * on error: we throw the error to the caller. It should finish the transaction and report the error to the user,
                because no receipt means there's no way we can recover on our own, and leaving the StoreKit transaction
                unfinished will result in never-ending tries.
 4. Exchange the receipt for a token that's worth product's Proton price amount of money
    * on error: we just ignore it and skip the rest of the steps. We assume the token will be properly obtained in step 9.
 5. Wait until the token is ready for consumption (status `chargeable`)
    * on error: we just ignore it and skip the rest of the steps. We assume the token will be properly obtained in step 9.
 6. Store the token and finish the part of the process that happens before the user account being created

 Please note that these steps process transaction during the signup flow, before the user account is created and authenticated.
 Because the user doesn't exist nor is authenticated, we cannot assign neither product nor the credits to the account.

 The second part — after the user account is created
 7. User account is authenticated (happens just after the creation)
 8. Kick off processing the unfinished IAP transactions from StoreKit's payment queue
 9. Retrieve the token worth product's Proton price of money from the storage. If the token is not available we effectively repeat steps 3-4:
    * we obtain the StoreKit receipt that hopefully confirms the IAP purchase (we don't check this locally)
    * we exchange the receipt for a token that's worth product's Proton price amount of money
    * we repeat step 9.
 10. Wait until the token is ready for consumption (status `chargeable`)
    * on error: throw away the token and get back to step 9. to kick off its error handling process
 11. Try exchanging the token for the Proton product
    * on error other then product not available or price mismatch: we give the user the ability to repeat the process from step 9.
                                                                   or to finish the Store Kit transaction and report the bug to the customer support
 12. If it fails because product is no longer available or its price changed, try exchanging the token for the equivalent amount of credits
    * on error other then product not available or price mismatch: we give the user the ability to repeat the process from step 9.
                                                                    or to finish the Store Kit transaction and report the bug to the customer support
 13. Finish the IAP transaction

 These steps happen only after the user is authenticated, so we can assign the product or credits to their account.
